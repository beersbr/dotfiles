# Dotfiles

Aggregated version of the dotfiles I use. I have collected things over the years and have removed almost all the things I dont use anymore. Some things have been "stolen" from other repos noted with a _Source: ..._ where applicable.

## Setup

This uses [GNU Stow](`https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/`) instead of the list of bash/python scripts I used previously. Download/install Stow and run `$ bash install.sh`.
